// Given four different points in space. Find whether these points can form a square or not. 

// You will be passed a single list where the fist element represents x1, second y1, third x2 and so on. e.g:

// A potential square is represented as => [x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4]

/**
 * Input: 
 * [20,10,10,20,20,20,10,10]
 * 
 * Output: 
 * True
 * 
 * Points (20,10), (10,20), (20,20), (10,10) form a square
